## LFLP Dataset

Due to the influence of COVID-19, the LFLP dataset will be released after the author returns to school. [[LFLP dataset link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1t9TSmZiDb5mVElaqS6M9XEUV9w_BuJiF?usp=sharing)]

### The testing set of LFLP is updated(2021/04/22), the training set of LFLP is coming soon.

## Trained Model

You can download the trained model which is reported in our paper at  [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1knTpVXt3gKGxqHMZQKz-T1q0r3TlsQxf/view?usp=sharing).

## Requirement

- Python 2.7
- PyTorch 0.4.0
- torchvision
- numpy

## Training

1. Set the path of pretrained ResNeXt model in resnext/config.py
2. Set the path of LFLP dataset in config.py
3. Run by `python train.py`

*Hyper-parameters* of training were gathered at the beginning of *train.py* and you can conveniently change them as you need.

## Testing

1. Put the trained model in ckpt/d4net
2. Run by `python infer.py`

*Settings* of testing were gathered at the beginning of *infer.py* and you can conveniently change them as you need.
